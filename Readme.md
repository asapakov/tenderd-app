The application also allows you to track real-time changes in IoT data (status, location, speedand distance). In case of a "breakdown" (maintenance) of the vehicle, the data is recorded in the 'Maintenance' tableand can bedisplayed to the client when clicking on the vehicle in the Dashboard section. The Analytics section providesanalytics on vehicles (average speed, average distance, etc.). The application also implements an IoT device simulator,which generates random data based on Scheduler and sends it to the server. In case of a 'breakdown' (maintenance) of thevehicle, itsstatus changes from 'active' to 'maintenance'. Cron job is running on the server, which checks whether the vehicle has avalid maintenance record in the database, compares 'startDate' and 'endDate' and changes the status to 'active' if thereareno active maintenance records.More detailed documentation of the endpoints can be found by launching the server and visiting thelink <b>http://localhost:<your-server-port>/api</b>Simple launching application with docker-compose:- Set the variables in the root folder .env file
